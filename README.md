# Python_Apps Repository

Welcome to my Python repository! This repository contains a collection of Python projects that I've worked on to improve my programming skills.

## Overview

This repository showcases a variety of Python projects, ranging from simple scripts to GUI applications. The goal is to demonstrate my learning progress and explore different areas of Python programming.

## Projects

Here's a detailed overview of the projects included in this repository:

*   **School\_details\_Collector.py:** A GUI application for collecting school details using `customtkinter`.
    *   **Description:** This project allows users to input school-related information through a graphical interface.
    *   **Dependencies:** `customtkinter`
    *   **How to Run:** `python School_details_Collector.py`
    *   **Areas for Improvement:**
        *   Improve GUI design and layout using `grid` or `place`.
        *   Add comments to explain the purpose of each widget and function.
        *   Implement input validation to ensure data integrity.
*   **anime\_maker.py:** A project that uses the `turtle` module to draw various anime characters.
    *   **Description:** This project demonstrates the use of the `turtle` module to create graphical drawings of anime characters like Doraemon, Shinchan, Pikachu, and Peppa Pig.
    *   **Dependencies:** `turtle`
    *   **How to Run:** `python anime_maker.py`
    *   **Areas for Improvement:**
        *   Break down the code into smaller, more modular functions.
        *   Improve the turtle graphics code for better performance and visual quality.
        *   Address the `turtle.Terminator` error by properly managing turtle windows.
*   **contacts.txt:** A simple text file used to store contact information.
    *   **Description:** This file stores contact information in a simple text format, with each line containing a name and phone number separated by a colon.
    *   **How to Use:** This file is used by other scripts to store and retrieve contact information.
    *   **Areas for Improvement:**
        *   Use a more structured format like JSON or CSV to store contact information.
*   **practise.txt:** A file used for practicing file I/O operations.
    *   **Description:** This file is used for experimenting with file input and output operations in Python.
    *   **How to Use:** This file is used by other scripts to practice reading from and writing to files.
    *   **Areas for Improvement:**
        *   Consider using a more descriptive name for this file.
